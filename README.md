It is a class 2-D version based _somewhat_ on the LMU [K'Tah](https://github.com/lmucs/ktah) project.

Features:
  - Player sprite (controlled by mouse movement)
  - Enemy skeleton sprites (follow the player at randomly generated speeds)
  - Health Meter (Max value at 100% which decreases when the player touches the enemy until 0%)
  - Decoy Models (dummy models which distract enemy characters)

Controls:
  - Movement: Player sprite moves towards the cursor
  - Mouse click:
    - Deploys a decoy
    - Resets game after "Game Over"
